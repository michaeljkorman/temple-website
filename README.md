# 🕯️ The Temple Project Website

Welcome, traveler. You've found the source for the temple's digital gateway.  
Here lives the code for our public site, a place where art, ritual, and business meet the web.

## 📜 What You’ll Find Here
- **The Gate** — a Linktree-style landing page with profile, social links, and pathways deeper in.  
- **The Answers** — our FAQ page, answering the most common questions and clearing away the fog.  
- **The Conversation** — an AI-generated podcast conversation that unpacks the meaning behind this project.
